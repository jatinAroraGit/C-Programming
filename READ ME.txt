Hey there fellow Coder/ Copier.
 
This is my repository which contains some of my C programming codes.

Each Workshop folder has 2 folders and 1 docx file inside. The docx file will tell you 
the purpose of the code. or for what is the purpose of a particular workshop. The Workshops are
split into two parts in lab and at home.

Happy Exploring.
