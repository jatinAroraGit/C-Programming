1- When passing an array to a function it is by address
The keyword const is used on pointer parameters.It allows parameter passing without 
copying anything but an address, but protects against changing the data.

2-When a function contains a parameter which is an array an additional variable of primitive data type 
which specifies or contains the value of size of that array.It is always passed alongside the array.
Example - in function-
void checkPrice(const struct Book book[],const int size);

const struct Book book[] is an array of size eqaul to the value passed in const int size.

3-The "const" used in front of array parameters makes it work in arrays of exactly the size defined in
 the declaration and it protects it against any change of data.
