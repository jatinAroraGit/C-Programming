1- In this program,the user is allowed to enter maximum valuse of days upto 10,so an array that can hold 10 values is declared,with 10 in []to make it hold 10 values.
2-Advantages:

a.      It is used to represent multiple data items of same type by using only single name.
b.      It can be used to implement other data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs etc.
c.      2D arrays are used to represent matrices.

Disadvantages:

a.      We must know in advance that how many elements are to be stored in array.
b.      Array is static structure. It means that array is not expandable. The stroing capacity cannot be altered of an array once specified.
c.      Since array is of fixed size, if we allocate more memory than required,it will lead to wastage of memory.
d.      The elements or values stored in array cannot be altered directly and it consumes time to do so.

3-The home portion was just right for me,it just expanded and we had to use more loops which was not very easy but not too hard as in Lab part we already used loops.
