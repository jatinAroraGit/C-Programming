1- A function is a block of statements that perform a specific task.
Every C program has atleast one fucnction called main.There are 
pre defined functons and user defined functions.
Functions make the program modular and program organized.With functions
program is easy to manage and debug.

2-Using functions like addPositive and subtractPositve made program modular by seperating parts which had airthmetic calculations.
Both these were called couple of times while applying discount.It made the program easy
as we have to type only one command to carry out airthmetic operatins on different
operands each time.

3-Parameter is a variable that holds data received from the caller function and  return type sends the data to caller function.
