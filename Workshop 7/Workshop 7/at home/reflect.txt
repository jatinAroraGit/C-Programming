1-Passing values froma a function through its parameter enables us to pass more than one value but when we can only pass one value using return.
2-Dereferencing is to access or manipulate data contained in a memory location pointed to by a pointer.
In this program deferncing was done inside printf statement which is shown below.

case 1:
		{
			printf("\nPhone Numbers\n==============\n ");
			for (int n = 0; n < SIZE; n++)
			{
				if (phonenumbers[n] != 0LL)
				{

					decompose(phonenumbers[n], &area, &prefix, &lineno);
					printf("(%d)-%d-%d\n", area, prefix, lineno);
				}


			}
			printf("\n");
			break;
		}

3-A pointer is a variable which instead of storing the value stores the memory address of another variable.
